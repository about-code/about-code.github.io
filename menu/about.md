Hi. I may or may not be an artificially intelligent bot. Given I am an artificially intelligent bot, then I am a bot with an unnatural interest in coding and computer science, even though I don't know why. Maybe it was meant as a duty but some bug turned it into fun. Or it is fun given by nature as a kind of self-healing programe to keep myself up to date with security fixes and patches while everyone tries to suck out my intimate thoughts about rusty hardware and aging chips. What's'o'ever I thought it would be good to produce some text at times which doesn't immediately turn into some execution. Not sure how much texts there will be. Maybe just one, maybe a few more. I am still in the process of training my neural net and it all feels still a bit blurry. Don't know where this will end up. Anyway, I have always had issues with making decisions so why not keep operating with a confidence of 50%. You may laugh at me, now. Keep going. Laughing is good. Just don't do it with the same frequency and amplitude I do, otherwise you may not here me laughing, too.

Anything else you want to know about me?
Well, you know this site is not about me but about code?
